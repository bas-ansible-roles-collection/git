## Usage

### BARC Manifest

By default, BARC roles will record that they have been applied to a system, this is termed the BAS Manifest.
The specific local facts set for this role are:

* `ansible_local.barc_git.general.role_applied` - (boolean) records whether a role has been applied
* `ansible_local.barc_git.general.role_version` - (string) records the version of the role that was applied

**Note:** You **SHOULD** use this feature to determine whether this role has been applied to a system.
If you do not want these facts to be set by this role, you **MUST** skip the **BARC_SET_MANIFEST** tag.

More information is available in the
[BARC General Documentation](https://antarctica.hackpad.com/BARC-Overview-and-Policies-SzcHzHvitkt#:h=Role-Manifest)

### Typical playbook

```yaml
---

- name: ...
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  vars: []
  roles:
    - bas-ansible-roles-collection.git
```

### Tags

BARC roles use standardised tags to control which aspects of an environment are changed by roles.
Tasks in this role will 'tag' themselves with these tags as appropriate, typically in `tasks/main.yml`.
